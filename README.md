Smart Crop Recommendation & Farming Marketplace System
This project helps farmers choose the best crops to grow and makes it easier for them to get the things they need like seeds, fertilizers, and tools.

We use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to suggest crops based on real-time data like:

Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK)
Soil moisture
pH level
Temperature
Humidity
Rainfall
Air quality
The system is powered by IoT sensors that collect data from the environment. Based on this, the platform recommends crops that are most suitable for that location.

It also works as a marketplace, where:

Farmers can request items they need
Buyers (like wholesalers) can respond with their offers
This project aims to reduce waste, improve productivity, and make farming smarter and easier!
