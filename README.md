# IOT-Based-Crop-Yield-Prediction-Using-Agrometeorological-Forecasting
This project helps farmers choose the best crops to grow and makes it easier for them to get the things they need like seeds, fertilizers, and tools.  We use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to suggest crops based on real-time data like:  Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK) Soil moisture pH level Temperature Humidity Rainfall Air quality.
